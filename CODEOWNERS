# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# These owners will be the default owners for everything in the repo.
# Unless a later match takes precedence, @assefamaru, @kofiav and @p-smirnov

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most precedence.
# When someone opens a pull request that only modifies Go files, only @go-owner
# and not the global owner(s) will be requested for a review.
